# GestureIt
Gesture Based Hardware Control Project Using Arduino.

# About The Developers
1) Rishabh Verma
2) Rishi Chandak
3) Saurabh Saluja
We are a group of 3 Crazy Developers working towards a Computer Science Engineering Graduate Degree.

# About The Project
We all know Human and Machines do not interact well. So in an attempt to bridge the Gap between humans and the systems they interact with, a plethora of input methods have been devised: keyboards, mice, game controllers, and touch screens. But Unfortunately none of these devices remove the barrier between man and machine.
With the Gesture Based Hardware Control system, we aim to remove this obstruction by allowing the user to control a hardware device using natural gestures. The Gesture Based Hardware Control takes advantage of a multitude of sensors to capture hand movements and uses this information to control a device â€“ in this case, a modified Remote Controlled car.
