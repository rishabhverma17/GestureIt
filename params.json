So in an attempt to bridge the Gap between humans and the systems they interact with, a plethora of input methods have been devised: keyboards, mice, game controllers, and touch screens. But Unfortunately none of these devices remove the barrier between man and machine.\r\nWith the Gesture Based Hardware Control system, we aim to remove this obstruction by allowing the user to control a hardware device using natural gestures. The Gesture Based Hardware Control takes advantage of a multitude of sensors to capture hand movements and uses this information to control a device â€“ in this case, a modified Remote Controlled car.\r\n\r\n# Tools and Technology used\r\nArduino Due Microcontroller.<br>\r\nArduino Mini pro.<br>\r\nXbee S2 wireless Module.<br>\r\nXbee Sheild.<br>\r\nXbee USB FTDI 232R Adapter.<br>\r\nFlex Sensor.<br>\r\n2 Force Sensor.<br>\r\nAccelerometer.<br>\r\n2 DC Motor.<br>\r\nL293D DC Motor H-Bridge.<br>\r\nBread Board / Proto Board.<br>\r\nRC Car.<br>\r\nLots Of connecting Wires.<br>\r\nArduino IDE.<br>\r\nprogrammed in C Language.<br>\r\n\r\n# This is an open source Hardware project\r\nFeel Free to use and modify the codes written by us and create something more useful out of it.<br>\r\nWe would love to see your codes.<br>\r\nHappy Coding!<br>\r\n",
